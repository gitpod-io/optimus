# Gitpod Community Discord Bot

This repo contains the code that runs the Gitpod Community Discord Bot, written in Rust. Initially a hackathon project built by [AXON](https://github.com/axonasif).

This bot does not use any traditional database structure but this could be improved at some point in the future. Currently, it is powered by a flat file database implementation.

Community contribuitions welcome! ðŸ§¡ Please create an issue and open a Gitpod workspace from that context.
